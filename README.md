# Project Introduction

This project contains the following key directories:

- **Cytnxtools**: Utility tools and helper functions based on the Cytnx library, all models rely on this folder.
- **onebody**: Implementation and data for one-body quantum problems(SHO Hydrogen), it just benchmark the twobody system.
- **twobody**: Code and resources related to build up two-body quantum systems (SHO, Hdrogen) and their simulations.

> **Warning:**  
> Please make sure the TCI folder path is correctly set according to your installation.  
> Modify the path in `Cytnxtools\tci.py` and also in the main code within the **twobody**, **onebody** folder before running the simulations.
